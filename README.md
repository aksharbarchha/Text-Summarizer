# Text-Summarizer
Summarization can be defined as a task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning.

## Impact
Summarization systems often have additional evidence they can utilize in order to specify the most important topics of document(s). For example, when summarizing blogs, there are discussions or comments coming after the blog post that are good sources of information to determine which parts of the blog are critical and interesting.

In scientific paper summarization, there is a considerable amount of information such as cited papers and conference information which can be leveraged to identify important sentences in the original paper.

 ## Types of Text Summarization
 1) Extractive Summarization
 2) Abstractive Summarization
 
 Extractive summarization means identifying important sections of the text and generating them verbatim producing a subset of the sentences from the original text; while       abstractive summarization reproduces important material in a new way after interpretation and examination of the text using advanced natural language techniques to generate a   new shorter text that conveys the most critical information from the original one.
